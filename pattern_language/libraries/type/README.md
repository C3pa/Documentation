# type

The `type` library contains a number of commonly used types that can be used like primitive built-in types.&#x20;

This library makes heavy use of the Pattern Language's `[[format_read]]`, `[[format_write]]` and `[[transform]]` attribute to make these types work and feel as native as possible.
