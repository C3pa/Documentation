The Welcome Screen is what shows up at the start when ImHex is loaded. It contains a bunch of frequently used options and information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pressing the `X` button at the top right will close the Welcome Screen without loading any file. Useful when you want to interact with features of ImHex that don't require any data to be loaded.
{% endhint %}

### Start
